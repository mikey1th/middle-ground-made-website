Democratization is Silispeak intentionally used to obfuscate monopolization. Put crudely, democratizers finance unnaturally cheap access to an expensive offering through funding provided by deep pocketed venture capitalists. Once the competitive landscape is destroyed the democratizers raise prices and refuse to increase the quality of the product being offered.  This is a problem, but it’s not a problem without a solution.

Centralization is foundational to democratization. Without one place where everything happens, democratization (which we can think of as cheap access to expensive offerings) cannot exist, even when being artificially popped up by the endless hordes of finance-bros. Tech CEOs who want to democratize something need to have a central hub. Without a platform that houses many components, and packages  dystopian levels of user-generated-data, democratizers don’t really have a viable method to appeal to their sponsors and reach their monopolistic end-game.

This is why decentralization is the solution to everything becoming democratized. As the name suggests when something is decentralized the central hub, the platform where everything happens, the dystopian level of packaged user-generated-data is non-existent, meaning the odds of whatever you’re using snowballing into a destructive venture-capital backed monopoly are meaningfully diminished.

Put another way, centralized, democratized platforms rely on the gravitational weight of their ecosystem to forcefully pull users to their core. On the other hand, decentralized un-democratized,  networks are dependent upon the cooperation of diversified offerings to form a compelling whole, a whole that easily becomes more than the sum of its parts, a whole that is a whole lot better than what the Silispeak democratizers want to offer us on a silver platter.

When we become okay with patching together a network of opinionated systems that collaborate to create a compelling solution not only do we simultaneously gift ourselves with a better product, but we dull the claws of a dangerous predator who often poses as a safe and viable alternative.
