Is a simple method to track and maintain your reading goals. Much like physical books, this analog system is free of distractions, network connections, and screen-based technology.

Here’s a simple framework to determine your pages per day.

Pick a book to read, record its page-count, and choose a number of days you’ll need to finish it. Divide the page count by the number of days, and boom! You’re done! 

Here’s an example for more context. If book has 300 pages, and you’d like to finish it in 20 days, you’d read 15 pages per-day.

Breaking-down reading this way is helpful because in multiple regards. First, it helps us finish the books we start, and second  it shows us if we stack enough small components we can eventually achieve a big outcome. Finishing a book, a project, a run, a meal, a whatever, is nothing more than consistently making a lot of small intentional decisions. And the Pages Per Day Framework shows us this each time we begin a reading session.

I hope you’ll give this small experiment a try, not to efficiently read more books, but to prove to that with enough reps there’s not much that can’t be done
