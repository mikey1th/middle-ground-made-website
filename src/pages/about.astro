        <p>What Middle Ground Made is has always changed. When I first started sharing work in {aboutMiddleGround.foundedDate} it wasn't anything. Middle Ground essentially started as a generic "bucket"
            for my creative work. In 2020 I called Middle Ground a "design shop" in 2021 after I release my first book I reframed Middle Ground as a "design and publishing" studio.
            Each change in perspective made Middle Ground more honest. Now though I think Middle Ground made is {aboutMiddleGround.whatIs}. I make products for {aboutMiddleGround.forProduct} and offer services to {aboutMiddleGround.forService}.
            I do all this from {aboutMiddleGround.location}. As a final note {aboutMiddleGround.owner} the founder and sole operator of Midde Ground Made.</p>
